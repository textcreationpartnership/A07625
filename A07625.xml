            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14079:47"/> of perfidiouſneſſe without which faith no converſion can profit, nor yet be at all: for the Apoſtolicall authoritie ſaith; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith is the foundation of all good things: faith is the beginning of humane ſalvation; without this faith no man can come to the number of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God: becauſe without it neither in this world doth any one obtaine the grace of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor in the world to come shall he poſſeſſe life everlaſting. And if any one doe not walke here by faith, he shall not come to the viſion. Without faith all mans labour is in vaine, for ſuch it is, as without the true faith whoſoever will pleaſe God by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world: as if one bending tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the countrie in which he knoweth he shall liue bleſſedly, should leaue the right way and improvidently follow errour, by which he cannot come to the bleſſed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but fall into precipice, where will be no ioy giuen to him that cometh, but deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought in to him that falleth.</p>
            <p>IN HOPE REPOSING MY SALVATION] A right order firſt to beleeue and confeſſe, then to hope. I haue beleeved and therfore haue I ſpoaken, and am over much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; ſaith the Pſalmiſt, as it were betwixt hope and feare.</p>

               <hi>Auguſtin. Encheridion ad Laurentium. Tom.</hi> 3. What can be hoped for which is not beleeved: and yet ſomething may be beleeved which is not hoped for. As, which of the faithfull beleeveth not the paines of the damned, and yet he doth not hope for them? and whoſoever beleeveth that they be now at hand, hanging over his head, and with a flying motion of his minde doth abhorre them, is better ſaid to feare then to hope. Which <hi>Lucan</hi> diſtinguishing, hath ſet downe thus: Lett him that feareth hope. Faith is both of evill things and good: for both good and evill things are beleeved and that with good, and not with evill faith. Faith is alſo of things paſt, and preſent, and to come, for we beleeue that Chriſt dyed, which now is paſſed: We beleeue that he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of the Father, which now is: We beleeue that he shall come to iudge, which is to be. Faith is alſo of a mans owne things, and of other mens, for everie man beleeveth of himſelfe that he had a beginning, and that he was not ever, and ſuch other things: nor only of other men but alſo of the Angels we beleeue many things that appertaine to Religion. But hope is only of good things, and thoſe to come, and belonging to him that is ſaid to hope for them. All which being ſo, for theſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14079:48"/> cauſes faith is to be diſtinguished from hope, as well in reaſonable difference as in the name. For in that belongeth to the not ſeeing either thoſe things that are beleeved or hoped for, it is common to faith and hope. In the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, the teſtimonie wherof the illuſtrious defenders of the Catholike rule haue vſed; faith is ſaid to be a convincing of thoſe things which are not ſeene. Although when any one ſaith himſelfe to haue beleeved, not words, nor witneſſes, nor any arguments, but the evidence of the preſent things, that is, to haue given credit to them, it ſeemeth not ſo abſurd, that he might rightly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in word, and it should be ſaid vnto him, thou haſt ſeene and therfore thou haſt not beleeved; whence it may be thought not to be conſequent that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thing is beleeved muſt not be ſeene, but better we call that faith which is taught by the divine word, of thoſe things, to witt which are not ſeene.</p>
            <p>And of hope the Apoſtle ſaith, hope which is ſeene is not hope; for that which one ſeeth, what doth he hope for? but if we hope for the things that we ſee not, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect with patience. When therfore future good things be beleeved of vs, they are no other thing then hoped for.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:14079:49"/>
            <p>Now what shall I ſay of loue without the which faith profiteth nothing? and hope without loue cannot be: To conclude, as <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith, the divelles beleeue and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet they doe not hope, or loue, but rather that which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leeving wee hope for and loue, they feare shall come vpon them. Wherfore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> approoveth &amp; commendeth the faith which worcketh by loue, which verily cannot be without hope, nor hope without loue, nor both without faith.</p>

               <hi>D. Thom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 17. Eternall beatitude is the proper obiect of hope. For we may not hope for leſſe of God then himſelfe, in enioying of whom conſiſteth life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. And ſuppoſing our vnion to our neighbour by loue, a man may by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Theologicall hope, hope for beatitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for him as well as for himſelfe:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 145. Hierem. 17.5.</note> but to confide in Princes or the ſonnes of men, concerning ſalvation, or to ſet our hope in man, the holy Ghoſt forbiddeth and giues a curſe to him that doth it. That faith being old will I keep in which a childe I was borne. <hi>Hieronymus ad Pammachium &amp; Ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, paulo ante finem. Tom.</hi> 2. Now doth faith ſwimme in many mens lippes, when in their heart there is either none at all, or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14079:49"/> that that is doth vehemently languish. For who doth not profeſſe that which we reade in the Deuteronomie. Heare Iſrael,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. &amp; 10.</note> thy Lord thy God is one Lord? And, thou shalt adore thy God and ſerue him alone? Who doth not daily recite with mouth, I beleeue in God the father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie? notwithſtanding he beleeveth not in God, that doth not place in him alone all the truſt of his felicitie: neither hath he one God and Lord that by harlot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, by riotte, and avarice, doth the commands of Sathan: nor doth he ſerue him alone, that ſerveth his bellie, that is given to this world which is ſet all vpon wickedneſſe. The heathens thinke there be many Gods, and doſt thou ſeeme to thy ſelfe a perfect Chriſtian, becauſe thou art perſuaded that there is but one God? What great matter doeſt thou? the Iewes doe the ſame, who daily blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Sonne of God in their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; the ſame doe the divells beleeue and tremble at it. If truly thou beleeveſt in God beleeue him to be iuſt and true. Iuſt in rewarding the good, and punishing the evill: true in his promiſes: beleeue that there is no hope of ſalvation but only in his Sonne whome he delivered to the croſſe for all of vs, and to death,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14079:50"/> beleeve that no evill can fall to them that deliver themſelues wholly over vnto his will; and doe perſever in the ſame, this is to beleeue in God the Father, this is to beleeue in his Sonne, this is to beleeue in the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Cyprian. de duplici martyrio longe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te finem.

            <p>It is worſe that a man will not confeſſe, then to contemne the law.

Thoſe things we are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to be Lords of, which doe moſt immediately obey the power of our will.

Our Lord commanded and the heavens were made: Our Lord commanded and the earth was made: Our Lord commanded and the ſeas were made: Our Lord commanded and every creature was engendred: you ſee of what operation the word of Chriſt is.
